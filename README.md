# XOR-using-perceptron-learning-rule-ANN


Implement (in C++) an algorithm that uses only perceptrons with threshold
activation functions and the perceptron learning rule (chapter 4 [Mitchell, 1997])
to solve the binary A XOR B problem. Table 1 shows the correct inputs and
outputs for the binary XOR problem.

Question 1: What is the minimum number of perceptrons required to solve
the XOR problem, and how should they be connected?

Question 2: Devise a list of training examples to teach the perceptrons to
solve the binary XOR problem. How many training examples did it take for
your algorithm to correctly learn to solve the binary XOR problem?
